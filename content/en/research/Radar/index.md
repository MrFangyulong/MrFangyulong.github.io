The Radar Group is dedicated to deeply integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies with radar meteorology, with a core research focus on convective storm nowcasting. To address the complex challenges in this field, we are exploring along two innovative paths: on one hand, leveraging large language models (LLM) and related architectures to process massive spatiotemporal data and mine complex patterns of convective storm evolution; on the other hand, targeting the pain point of scarce extreme weather samples, we are specifically developing few-shot learning methods based on small models to achieve efficient and accurate forecasting with minimal samples. In addition, we are conducting research on synthetic radar retrieval, aiming to compensate for observation blind spots through AI algorithms, providing more complete data support for forecasting models, and building a more intelligent and agile extreme weather warning system.
